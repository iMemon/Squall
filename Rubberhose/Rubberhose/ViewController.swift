//Rubberhose

//This project is a proof of concept and is meant to illustrate the power of dynamic expressions in Squall.
//
//The AE comp was setup with version 1 of the popular Rubberhose plugin which makes extensive use of expressions
//to create floppy limbs. But this first version of Rubberhose also uses a lot of code obfuscation techniques
//which make it very difficult and computationally expensive to properly resolve the attached expressions.
//Squall can resolve the controls accurately but it is not very fast. Future version of Rubberhose or Squall may 
//change this.
//
//The project shows a circle which is attached to two rubber hoses. You can move it around by panning the screen or 
//you can grow the circle by pressing down on the display (your iOS device needs to support force touch).
//This is achieved by connecting the touch input of the device to the expression controls in our After Effects
//composition and then Squall dynamically reevaluating the connected expressions.
//
//This mechanism is employed similarly in the Squall companion app.
